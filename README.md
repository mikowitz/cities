# Cities

## Workflow

### Segmenting

* Overlay timelines of city name (in morse/Messaien) and set name

### Letter dynamic envelopes
* Extract city + letter graphs (linear, cubic, average of the 2)
* Normalize them all from `[min, max]` to `[0, 1/(length of city)]`
    (this is so that at worst, the highest volume of the piece is 1)
